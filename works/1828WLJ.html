					Introduction</h3>
				<h4>

					Overview</h4>
				<p>Wang Lao Ji (WLJ) is a very popular tea brand in China; however, the brand and flavor is new to the
					Taiwanese
					people. Our proprietor introduces this brand to Taiwan and uses WLJ tea products as a base in
					creating new
					beverages, which form the foundation of a brand new tea shop, 1828 WLJ Tea Shop. There are seven
					branches in
					Taiwan. This brand is creative and enticing, since the beverage’s name and design are inspired by
					traditional
					Chinese stories.

				<h3>Step 1. User Research</h3>
				<h4>Questionnaire & Insights</h4>
				<p>
					I used an online questionnaire to survey customers' experiences when purchasing drinks at the tea shop in
					Taiwan. I was able to obtain over 150 responses in five days. The following important insights were gleaned
					from these responses:
				</p>

				<p><b class="point">1. For a tea shop, "flavor" is the most important thing:</b> In Taiwan, over 80% of
					respondents bought at least one drink in a tea shop every week, and the largest reason respondents love a tea
					shop is the flavor of its tea.</p>

				<p><b class="point">2. For a tea shop application, "getting a lower price" and "an online ordering mechanism" is
						important:</b>
					Generally, when it comes to a tea shop application, respondents prefer to get a discounted price for their
					drinks, so they like to see regular marketing events or coupons. Additionally, in Taiwan, people always have
					to wait in line when they want to purchase a drink, so it is nice to have an online ordering mechanism in the
					application as well.</p>

			<div class="list">
				<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
				<p>
					According to the data from our POS system, 77.2% of our customers are first-time customers and 22.8% are
					returning customers. The application’s business goal is to retain customers. As a result, the two challenges
					we address are (1) converting first-time customers to repeat customers, and (2) encouraging returning
					customers to purchase drinks more frequently.

			<div class="list">
				<h3>Step 2. Emphasizing Our Customers</h3>
				<h4>Customer Persona</h4>

				<p>
					We categorize our customer persona according to their visit frequency. Almost 80% of customers are first-time
					customers while only about 20% are returning customers.

				<h4>Pain Points</h4>
				<p>
					1. <b class="point">The flavor is not acceptable.</b> Many drinks are mixed with traditional Chinese medicine,
					which might be good for health, but the flavor is not very palatable for Taiwanese people. Taiwanese people
					prefer sweet milk tea with boba or pure green tea instead.

				</p>

				<p>
					2. <b class="point">It is too expensive.</b> The beverage price in our tea shop is between NT$60 and NT$80;
					however, the general beverage price at other tea shops ranges between NT$30 and NT$60. Customers don't
					understand why we are more expensive than other tea shops, so we need to demonstrate our values to customers.
				</p>

				<p>
					3. <b class="point">Downloading the application before checking out is very troublesome and inconvenient.</b>
					Some customers may feel the application poses a security risk to download and log into on their phones. Also,
					if they are busy, downloading the application to get coupons might be an obstacle to them purchasing a drink.

				<h3>Step 3. Ideation</h3>
				<h4>Ideas for solving the pain points</h4>
				<p>
					New customers should not be forced to download our application when they visit our store. Instead, we should
					place a sticker on their cups that advertises and encourages customers to download our application. The
					stickers could contain a serial number or QR code that directs customers to our application, which they can
					use to begin collecting points or learning about our special events.

			<div class="list">
				<h4>Ideas for the tea shop application</h4>
				<p>
					We should put more emphasis on converting first-time customers to repeat customers. According to user
					research, first-time customers want to get more information and cheaper prices from the application.
				</p>
				<p><b class="point">For providing information,</b> we intend to advertise (1) regular marketing events, (2) the
					menu, and (3) the branch location. However, user research indicated that users do not find it necessary to
					include a branch location in the application. This is likely because users can search for branch locations on
					Google Maps directly. To encourage customers to use the application, I suggest that we create a way to allow
					them to check-in at different branch locations. When they have checked in at three or more locations, they
					earn a reward for a free beverage.</p>
				<p>
					<b class="point">For obtaining cheaper prices,</b> we plan to have (1) coupons for regular marketing events,
					(2) rewards from games in our application, and (3) loyalty cards.

				<h3>Step 4. User Flow & Prototype</h3>
				<h4>Beverage Ordering Interface
				</h4>
				<p>Ordering beverages is an important part of our application, which can actually be used to generate
					revenue.
					However, it's very complex, since there are many different orders and payment methods that can be
					used. The
					process of creating this interface required many discussions and testing phases.

			<div class="seperate"> ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;·</div>

			<div class="list">
				<h4>Lottery Game Interface</h4>
				<p>When customers buy our drinks or visit our application, they receive one point to use towards the
					lottery
					game, which offers prizes to customers. People who use multiple points in one lottery game will have
					a better
					chance of winning the prize. For example, an iPhone requires 30,000 points. If a customer uses one
					point
					towards this prize, then he will have a 1/30,000 chance to win this prize. Because we offer many
					great prizes,
					customers will use a few points toward different prizes, which means that the prizes will take
					longer to win.


				</p>

				<p>I have suggested an idea that we put a ranking on the number of points our customers use towards
					their
					prizes. For example, when a person plays a basketball shooting machine, a high score record is
					displayed,
					which the person always wants to beat. Many other individuals are driven by a desire to win. If we
					have a top
					ten ranking of how many points users dedicated towards each prize, it could encourage customers to
					use more
					points.

			<div class="list">
				<h4>The Location Interface</h4>
				<p>It is also important for customer to be able to find the nearest tea shop. However, customers can
					also find
					this information on Google Maps. To encourage customers to use the application, I suggest that we
					could create
					a way to let them check-in at different branch locations. When they have visited five or more
					branches, they
					earn a reward for a free beverage.

			<div class="list">
				<h4>Special Event - Shake Your Phone</h4>
				<p>Our customers seemed to only open the application when they wanted to buy beverages. To increase
					engagement,
					we created an event wherein customers could obtain a discount coupon once per day by opening our
					application
					and shaking their phones. When customers open our application and shake their phones during the
					event period,
					we will give them a coupon for 60%, 50%, 30%, or 20% off according to a certain probability. It is a
					persuasive strategy in interaction design intended to encourage long-term engagement and customer
					loyalty.

				</p>

				<p>It is also an aesthetically pleasing design that is inspired by traditional Chinese culture. An
					Imperial
					decree which contains a coupon will expand when customers shake their phones. This event is
					available by web
					view on our iOS and Android application, so I designed and hand-coded it.

				<h3>Project Learnings</h3>
				<h4>Communication is important.</h4>
				<p>


					I am aware of the large gap between users and developers. For example, some functions are very
					helpful and user-friendly, thereby engaging users. However, developers may need to spend a lot of
					time on these. Other times, there are technical restrictions that delay the planning or completion
					of a project. Thus, to achieve a near-perfect product, communication is very important.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am impressed by our project manager because he excelled at communicating, always focused
					on the
					common
					goal rather than any individual, and he did not show any emotions while communicating. He always
					worked smoothly, gaining everybody’s respect. I believe that I must learn and develop these
					qualities.
