				<h4>Overview</h4>
				<p>Wang Lao Ji (WLJ) is a very popular tea brand in China; however, the brand and flavor is new to the
					Taiwanese
					people. Our proprietor introduces this brand to Taiwan and uses WLJ tea products as a base in
					creating new
					beverages, which form the foundation of a brand new tea shop, 1828 WLJ Tea Shop. There are seven
					branches in
					Taiwan. This brand is creative and enticing, since the beverage’s name and design are inspired by
					traditional
					Chinese stories.

				<h4>Business Goal - Challenge & Solution</h4>
				<p>
					<b>Challenge</b><br>
					According to the data from our POS system, we have discovered that 80% of our customers are first
					time
					customers, and 20% are returning customers. This application’s business goal is to convert new
					customers to
					repeat customers. The two challenges we address are

					<br>
					1. To convert first-time customers to repeat customers
					<br>
					2. To make returning guest to buy the drink more often
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Solution</b><br>
					To appeal to new customers, we offer coupons that allow them to try our beverages at a lower cost.
					Additionally, we utilize some long-term games, such as a lottery game and location check-ins, which
					requires
					time to receive rewards and encourages long-term engagement.

				<h4>Competitor Analysis - DaYung's Tea Shop's Application
				</h4>
				<p>
					<b>Advangtages</b><br>
					Since this tea shop is very popular and has several branches in Taiwan, they have many loyal
					customers. The
					main function of their application is for their customers to collect points or view information
					about the tea
					shop. In conclusion, there are two main advantages:

					<br>
					1. The application offers a loyalty program that rewards frequent visitors. <br>
					2. The information is clear and concise.
				</p>


				<p>
					<b>Disadvangtages</b><br>
					This application appears to be only for long-term or repeat customers. However, since their loyalty
					program
					offers a physical card, it’s not necessary for customers to collect points on the application. They
					also do
					not use the application to market any special events, which could appeal to new or potential
					customers. To sum
					it up, there are two disadvantages:

					<br>
					1. It’s not necessary for their loyalty program. <br>
					2. They do not market for special events that could appeal to new or potential customers.

				<h4>Persona</h4>
				<p>
					Different customers could use the application differently. Therefore, I categorized them into two
					customer
					types based on their visit frequency.

				</p>


				<p>
					<b>1. Returning customers - Visits our stores more than three times.</b>
					<!--<br>
					Customer traits: often visit China, love the flavor of WLJ


					 <br>


					Customer actions: <br>

					- Collect points for rewards<br>
					- Use the delivery service<br>
					- Stay up to date on the latest news and special events<br>
					- Attend the games to win prizes -->

				</p>

				<!-- <p>
					<b>2. New customers - Visits our stores three times or fewer.</b><br>
					Customer traits: passer-by, intrigued by special events, enjoys trying new flavors


					<br>

					Customer Actions:
					<br>

					- Utilize coupons to try the drink at a reduced cost

				<h4>Beverage Ordering Interface
				</h4>
				<p>Ordering beverages is an important part of our application, which can actually be used to generate
					revenue.
					However, it's very complex, since there are many different orders and payment methods that can be
					used. The
					process of creating this interface required many discussions and testing phases.

				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="seperate"> ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;·</div>

			<div class="list">
				<h4>Lottery Game Interface</h4>
				<p>When customers buy our drinks or visit our application, they receive one point to use towards the
					lottery
					game, which offers prizes to customers. People who use multiple points in one lottery game will have
					a better
					chance of winning the prize. For example, an iPhone requires 30,000 points. If a customer uses one
					point
					towards this prize, then he will have a 1/30,000 chance to win this prize. Because we offer many
					great prizes,
					customers will use a few points toward different prizes, which means that the prizes will take
					longer to win.


				</p>

				<p>I have suggested an idea that we put a ranking on the number of points our customers use towards
					their
					prizes. For example, when a person plays a basketball shooting machine, a high score record is
					displayed,
					which the person always wants to beat. Many other individuals are driven by a desire to win. If we
					have a top
					ten ranking of how many points users dedicated towards each prize, it could encourage customers to
					use more
					points.

			<div class="list">
				<h4>The Location Interface</h4>
				<p>It is also important for customer to be able to find the nearest tea shop. However, customers can
					also find
					this information on Google Maps. To encourage customers to use the application, I suggest that we
					could create
					a way to let them check-in at different branch locations. When they have visited five or more
					branches, they
					earn a reward for a free beverage.

			<div class="list">
				<h4>Special Event - Shake Your Phone</h4>
				<p>Our customers seemed to only open the application when they wanted to buy beverages. To increase
					engagement,
					we created an event wherein customers could obtain a discount coupon once per day by opening our
					application
					and shaking their phones. When customers open our application and shake their phones during the
					event period,
					we will give them a coupon for 60%, 50%, 30%, or 20% off according to a certain probability. It is a
					persuasive strategy in interaction design intended to encourage long-term engagement and customer
					loyalty.

				</p>

				<p>It is also an aesthetically pleasing design that is inspired by traditional Chinese culture. An
					Imperial
					decree which contains a coupon will expand when customers shake their phones. This event is
					available by web
					view on our iOS and Android application, so I designed and hand-coded it.

				<h4>Customer Experience in Tea Shop Store</h4>
				<p>
					<b>Problem</b><br>
					When there are some events being marketed in our application, I often see many customers in our
					store
					downloading and using the application. Some customers may feel the application poses a security risk
					or that
					it is inconvenient to download on their phone. We wanted to make customers felt comfortable
					downloading the
					application instead of feeling pressured.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="list-img">
				<img src="../img/portfolio/teashop/lineup.jpg" alt="" style="max-width: 600px;">
				<div class="caption">Many people are busy downloading our application to get coupons while they are in
					line.

				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="seperate"></div>


			<div class="list">
				<p>
					<b>Solution</b><br>
					We should not force new customers to download our application when they visit the store. Instead, we
					should
					offer coupons and games in stores so that all of our customers can access our promotions equally.

				</p>

				<p>To encourage customers to use our application, we can put a sticker on their cups. The stickers could
					contain
					a serial number or QR code that directs customers to our application, where they can begin
					collecting points
					or learning about our special events.

				<h4>Project Learnings</h4>
				<p>
					<b>Communication is important.</b><br>

					I am aware of the large gap between users and developers. For example, some functions are very
					helpful and user-friendly, thereby engaging users. However, developers may need to spend a lot of
					time on these. Other times, there are technical restrictions that delay the planning or completion
					of a project. Thus, to achieve a near-perfect product, communication is very important.

					Moreover, I am impressed by our project manager because he excelled at communicating, always focused
					on the
					common
					goal rather than any individual, and he did not show any emotions while communicating. He always
					worked smoothly, gaining everybody’s respect. I believe that I must learn and develop these
					qualities.
